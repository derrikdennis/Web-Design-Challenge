# Web Visualization Dashboard - Web-Design-Challenge

## Background

Data is more powerful when we share it with others!  In this assignment, I am taking the information received in the Python-API challenege, updating it and putting it into a webpage!


## Website requirements

The website must consist of the seven pages total, including:

* A[landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project
  * Links to each visualization page.

* Four visualization pages:
  * [Latitude vs temperature](#latitude-vs-temp)
  * [Latitude vs cloudiness](#latitiude-vs-cloud)
  * [Latitude vs Humidity](#latitude-vs-humid)
  * [Latitude vs Wind Speed](#latitude-vs-wind)
  * Each must have the following:
    * A descriptive title and heading tag
    * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison
    * A paragraph descriing the plot and its significance.

* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily compare them.
  * Uses a bootstrap grid for he visualizations.
    * he grid must be twi visualizations across screens medium and large and one across small and extra small


* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containg the data used in the visualizations.
  * The table must be a bootstrap table component
  * The data must come from exporting the `.csv` file as HTML.
