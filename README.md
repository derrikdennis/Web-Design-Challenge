## Webpage

The webpage for this project can be found at <https://derrikdennis.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge>

## Background

Data is more powerful when we share it with others!  In this assignment, I am taking the information received in the Python-API challenege, updating it and putting it into a webpage!


## Website Requirements

The website must consist of the seven pages total, including:

* A [landing page](https://derrikdennis.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge) containing:
  * An explanation of the project
  * Links to each visualization page.

* Four visualization pages:
  * [Latitude vs temperature](#latitude-vs-temp)
  * [Latitude vs cloudiness](#latitiude-vs-cloud)
  * [Latitude vs Humidity](#latitude-vs-humid)
  * [Latitude vs Wind Speed](#latitude-vs-wind)
  * Each must have the following:
    * A descriptive title and heading tag
    * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison
    * A paragraph descriing the plot and its significance.

* A ["comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily compare them.
  * Uses a bootstrap grid for he visualizations.
    * he grid must be twi visualizations across screens medium and large and one across small and extra small


* A ["data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containg the data used in the visualizations.
  * The table must be a bootstrap table component
  * The data must come from exporting the `.csv` file as HTML.

## Navigation Requirements

The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nva which allows users to return to the landing page.
* Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each of the visualization pages
* Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page and "Data" which links to the data page
* Is responsive.  The nav must have similar behavior as the pages

## Deployment Requirements

The website must be deployed to GitHub pages.
